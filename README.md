# Golf Card Game 🃏⛳️

Welcome to **Golf Card Game**, a simple card game built with **JavaScript** where players aim to get the lowest score, just like in the real game of golf! 🏌️‍♂️

This is my first attempt at building a card game, and I’m really excited to share it with you! 🎉


## About the Game

The goal of the game is to have the lowest score possible by swapping cards from your hand. Each card has a point value, and you can either swap a card from the deck or from the discard pile. This version is a simplified version of the popular **Golf** card game, and it’s built with plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 🎯

It’s a project I’ve been working on to improve my JavaScript skills, and I’d love feedback!

## How to Play

1. The game starts with each player having 6 cards face down.
2. Players take turns swapping their cards with either the deck or discard pile.
3. Each card has a value:
   - **Numbered cards** (2–10): Same value as the number.
   - **Jacks**: 0 points (great card to have!).
   - **Queens and Kings**: 10 points (not so great 😅).
4. At the end of the game, the player with the lowest total score wins.

Technologies Used

	•	JavaScript: Handles the game logic and card shuffling.
	•	HTML: The structure of the game board and player interface.
	•	CSS: Styling to make it look nice and responsive.

Challenges

As this is my first time building a card game, I faced a few challenges along the way:

	•	Shuffling the deck: I had to learn how to randomize arrays in JavaScript.
	•	Handling turns: It took a bit of trial and error to get the turns working smoothly between players.
	•	Scoring system: Keeping track of each player’s score was tricky at first, but I’m really proud of how it turned out.

Future Improvements

There’s always room for improvement! Here’s what I’m thinking for the next version:

	•	🤖 AI Opponent: Add a computer player so you can play solo.
	•	🎨 Better UI: I want to add animations and improve the design.
	•	💾 Save Progress: Let the players save their game and come back later.
	•	📱 Mobile Optimization: Fine-tune the mobile experience.

Feel free to suggest more features by opening an issue!
